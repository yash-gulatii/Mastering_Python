# Python Mastery Challenge: Roadmap Edition

#### Welcome to the Python Mastery Challenge! In this challenge, i will follow the roadmap provided by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/python) to further enhance my Python skills and become a master in the language. The challenge is designed to help me reinforce my existing knowledge while exploring advanced topics and best practices in Python.The key to mastering Python is practice and hands-on experience. I will allocate dedicated time to work on each section of the roadmap, completing exercises, and building projects. I will append my learning in this readme file sorted by days.

## Day 8 of Python Mastery Challenge (23 July 2023) 📚💻

- #### 🔍 Explored the "Heap Data Structure" 📊

  - Heap is a complete binary tree satisfying the heap property: max heap (parent > child) or min heap (parent < child).
  - Key applications include priority queues, Dijkstra's algorithm, and heap sort.

- #### 📈 Understood Heap Operations:

  - Heapify: Convert binary tree to a heap (max or min).
  - Insert: Add an element to the heap and maintain the heap property.
  - Delete: Remove an element from the heap and rearrange to maintain the heap property.
  - Peek: Get the maximum/minimum element without removing it.
  - Extract-Max/Min: Get and remove the maximum/minimum element from the heap.

- #### 📝 Studied Fibonacci Heap:

  - Collection of min heap-ordered trees with efficient operations.
  - Supports union, insert, extract min, decrease key, and delete node operations.

- #### 🔢 Python Example for Fibonacci Heap:

  - Implemented Fibonacci Heap and tested insertion, extract min operations.

Day 9 of Python Mastery Challenge (01 August 2023) 📚💻

- #### 🔍 Today, delved into the "Decrease Key and Delete Node Operations" 🔄 on a Fibonacci Heap 🌿

- #### 🌟 A Fibonacci heap is tree-based and efficient, surpassing binomial and binary heaps in time complexity for certain operations.

- #### ⚙️ Learned about "Decrease a Key" operation:

  - Decreases a key's value to a lower one.
  - Utilizes functions like Decrease Key, Cut, and Cascading-Cut to maintain the heap's properties.

- #### 🎯 Decrease Key Example:

  - Explored examples of decreasing keys from 46 to 15 and 35 to 5, demonstrating the Cut and Cascading-Cut operations.

- #### ⚙️ Explored "Deleting a Node" operation:

  - Utilizes decrease-key and extract-min operations to remove a given node from the heap.

- #### 📝 Shared Python Example for Fibonacci Heap:

  - Implemented Fibonacci Heap and tested operations with example elements.

- #### 🔢 Complexities:

  - Decrease Key: O(1)
  - Delete Node: O(log n)

- #### 🔗 Solved a Leetcode question "Contains Duplicate" using Python and a hashset. 🐍
