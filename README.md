## Day 8 of Python Mastery Challenge (23 July 2023) 📚💻

- #### 🔍 Explored the "Heap Data Structure" 📊

  - Heap is a complete binary tree satisfying the heap property: max heap (parent > child) or min heap (parent < child).
  - Key applications include priority queues, Dijkstra's algorithm, and heap sort.

- #### 📈 Understood Heap Operations:

  - Heapify: Convert binary tree to a heap (max or min).
  - Insert: Add an element to the heap and maintain the heap property.
  - Delete: Remove an element from the heap and rearrange to maintain the heap property.
  - Peek: Get the maximum/minimum element without removing it.
  - Extract-Max/Min: Get and remove the maximum/minimum element from the heap.

- #### 📝 Studied Fibonacci Heap:

  - Collection of min heap-ordered trees with efficient operations.
  - Supports union, insert, extract min, decrease key, and delete node operations.

- #### 🔢 Python Example for Fibonacci Heap:

  - Implemented Fibonacci Heap and tested insertion, extract min operations.

## Day 9 of Python Mastery Challenge (01 August 2023) 📚💻

- #### ⚙️ Learned about "Decrease a Key" operation:

  - Decreases a key's value to a lower one.
  - Utilizes functions like Decrease Key, Cut, and Cascading-Cut to maintain the heap's properties.

## Day 10 of Python Mastery Challenge (02 August 2023) 📚💻

- #### 🌳🔍 Explored Tree Data Structure! 🌳

- #### 🔎 Tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. 🌿

- #### 📚 Tree Terminologies:

  - Nodes: Entities with key/value and pointers to child nodes.
  - Edges: Links between nodes.
  - Root: Topmost node.
  - Height of a Node: Number of edges to deepest leaf.
  - Depth of a Node: Number of edges from root to node.
  - Height of a Tree: Height of root or depth of deepest node.
  - Degree of a Node: Total branches of a node.
  - Forest: Collection of disjoint trees.

- #### 🌟 Tree Applications:

  - Binary Search Trees (BSTs) for quick element presence check.
  - Heap for heap sort.
  - Tries in modern routers for routing info.
  - Popular databases use B-Trees and T-Trees for data storage.

## 🌳 Day 11 of Python Mastery Challenge (03 August 2023) 📚💻

- #### 🔍 Explored "Tree Traversal" in Data Structures and Algorithms.

- #### 🌿 Traversing a tree means visiting every node in the hierarchical structure, unlocking a realm of possibilities for operations like summing values or finding the largest one.

- #### 🔄 Learned three traversal techniques: "Inorder," "Preorder," and "Postorder."

  - 1️⃣ Inorder: Left subtree ➡️ Root ➡️ Right subtree.
  - 2️⃣ Preorder: Root ➡️ Left subtree ➡️ Right subtree.
  - 3️⃣ Postorder: Left subtree ➡️ Right subtree ➡️ Root.

- #### 🌟 Embracing these techniques not only respects the hierarchy of the tree but also maintains the correct order of nodes throughout the process.

- #### 🌳 Dived into the captivating world of "Binary Trees."

- #### ✨ Encountered types like Full, Perfect, Complete, Degenerate, Skewed, and Balanced Binary Trees.

- #### 📝 Implemented Python examples for tree traversal and delved deeper into the exciting realm of Binary Trees.

- #### 🌿 Dived into "Perfect Binary Trees" - nodes have 2 child nodes, leaves at the same level.

- #### 🌳 "Complete Binary Trees" - all levels filled, last element may lack right sibling.

- #### 🌟 Python examples checked binary tree types.

- #### 📝 Practice with Python examples.
