### Binary Search

**Algorithm -**

**Step 1** - Take the target search value.

**Step 2** - Find the middle of a array and check if target is greater or smaller than the middle.

**Step 3** - If target is greater than middle then take the first half of array. Else if target is smaller than middle then take the second half of the array.

**Step 4** - Reapeat the above steps until you find the value or the array ends.

**Efficiency -**

| Array Size | Iterations |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 0          | 0          |
| 1          | 1          |
| 2          | 2          |
| 3          | 2          |
| 4          | 3          |
| 5          | 3          |
| 6          | 3          |
| 7          | 3          |
| 8          | 4          |

**O(log(n))**
